# About Me

I currerntly work as an Applications Engineering Lead at [BiologIC Technologies](https://biologic-tech.com/). Previously I worked as an Application Scientist and later as a Senior Scientist at [Lightcast Discovery](https://www.lightcast.bio/). 

Prior to that, I was a Research Associate in Soft Matter Biophysics at the [Division of Pharmacy and Optometry](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/facultiesandschools/division-of-pharmacy--optometry(92ec216d-1e7a-411b-aaae-317c29e3cf88).html), [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) in the group of [Dr Richard Campbell](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/richard.campbell.html). My research focused on the interactions of nanoparticles with model lung surfactant systems to stimulate and characterise reservoir nucleation in lipid biomembranes under respiratory conditions. For the investigation of the interactions I used interfacial characterisation techniques such as Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM), ellipsometry, optical and neutron reflectometry.

Prior to this I completed a PhD at the [Institute of Multiscale Thermofluids](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/imt), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), working under the supervision of [Dr John Christy](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-john-christy) and [Professor Khellil Sefiane](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-khellil-sefiane). My research focused on the drying of micro-litre droplets of biological fluids (such as blood serum or urine) as a tool for early disease diagnosis; specifically for bladder cancer. In particular, I was interested in how the substrate properties, environmental conditions and fluid composition affect the drying process, internal flows and final desiccation patterns arising from droplet evaporation. 

Originally from Limassol, Cyprus, I received a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and a MSc in Biomedical Engineering from the [Cyprus University of Technology](https://www.cut.ac.cy/?languageId=1). Over the duration of my master’s I was member of the [BioLISYS (Biomechanics and Living Systems Analysis) Lab](http://biolisys.cut.ac.cy/) at the Cyprus University of Technology where I worked on the development of a targeted breast cancer treatment via the use of Wharton’s Jelly mesenchymal stem cells, under the supervision of [Professor Andreas Anayiotos](http://biolisys.cut.ac.cy/employees/prof-andreas-anayiotos-2/) and [Dr Konstantinos Kapnisis](http://biolisys.cut.ac.cy/employees/dr-konstantinos-kapnisis-2/).
