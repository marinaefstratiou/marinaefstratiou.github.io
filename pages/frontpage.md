# About Me
I am a PhD Candidate at the [Institute of Multiscale Thermofluids](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/imt), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), working under the supervision of [Dr John Christy](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-john-christy) and [Professor Khellil Sefiane](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-khellil-sefiane). My research focuses on the drying of micro-litre droplets of biological fluids (such as blood serum or urine) as a tool for early disease diagnosis; specifically for bladder cancer. In particular, I am interested in how the substrate properties, environmental conditions and fluid composition affect the drying process, internal flows and final desiccation patterns arising from droplet evaporation. 

Originally from Limassol, Cyprus, I received a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and a MSc in Biomedical Engineering from the [Cyprus University of Technology](https://www.cut.ac.cy/?languageId=1). Over the duration of my master’s I was member of the [BioLISYS (Biomechanics and Living Systems Analysis) Lab](http://biolisys.cut.ac.cy/) at the Cyprus University of Technology where I worked on the development of a targeted breast cancer treatment via the use of Wharton’s Jelly mesenchymal stem cells, under the supervision of [Professor Andreas Anayiotos](http://biolisys.cut.ac.cy/employees/prof-andreas-anayiotos-2/) and [Dr Konstantinos Kapnisis](http://biolisys.cut.ac.cy/employees/dr-konstantinos-kapnisis-2/).
