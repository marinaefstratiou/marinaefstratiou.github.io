I am a PhD Candidate at the Institute of Multiscale Thermofluids, University of Edinburgh, working under the supervision of Dr John Christy and Professor Khellil Sefiane. My research focuses on the drying of micro-litre droplets of biological fluids (such as blood serum or urine) as a tool for early disease diagnosis; specifically for bladder cancer. In particular, I am interested in how the substrate properties, environmental conditions and fluid composition affect the drying process, internal flows and final desiccation patterns arising from droplet evaporation. 
Originally from Limassol, Cyprus, I received a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and Material Science and a MSc in Biomedical Engineering from the Cyprus University of Technology. Over the duration of my master’s I was member of the BioLISYS (Biomechanics and Living Systems Analysis) Lab at the Cyprus University of Technology where I worked on the development of a targeted breast cancer treatment via the use of Wharton’s Jelly mesenchymal stem cells, under the supervision of Professor Andreas Anayiotos and Dr Konstantinos Kapnisis.
