# PhD Research
## Background and Motivation

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial issues in medicine. Disease causes alterations in the properties of biological fluids, indicating biomarkers associated with certain phenomena. These alterations lead to changes in the final desiccation patterns arising from droplet evaporation on surfaces. For example, a blood droplet acquired from a healthy individual would demonstrate a different desiccation patterns compared to that acquired from a cancer patient. Hence, the investigation of the drying patterns of bio-fluid droplets is of great importance as it could provide the means for rapid medical diagnosis, offering the possibility to detect disease at early stages. This would reduce the cost of sample collection and storage and hazards related to large amounts of biological fluids. 

## Overview

The aim of my thesis is to examine the effect of various parameters on the evaporative behaviour, internal flows and final desiccation patterns of micro-litre droplets of biological fluids, as a tool for the early diagnosis of bladder cancer. Specifically, many aspects affect the drying dynamics and the final desiccation patterns. These include the fluid composition, substrate properties wettability and temperature and ambient conditions such as temperature and humidity.
